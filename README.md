# Scara Drawing-Arm

## Problem

To make a Scara drawing arm that will draw an image, specifically the sigma lab logo. 


## Supplies needed

-2 stepper motors
-A servo 
-Arcylic 3mm
-3d printed part...
-Arduino
-Arduino cnc shield
-Stepper motor driver board
-grbl repository



## Milestones?

Converting g-code to arduino, a specific design that works
- g-code was hard to code so we found a grbl repository that is compatible with the universal grbl convertor. In doing so this makes it easier to convert the code.

A proper design 
- There are 3 examples we're going off of and from these 3 examples we combined them and created a rough sketch of what would it would look like.

Having an arm that moves with a sturdy base/arm
- tbd
Having the arm move with g-code coordinates converted to polar coordinates
- tbd
Finalize code
- tbd


## Timeline?

-Plan and research code
-Write code and prototype
-Prototype/plan arm
-Design arm
-Finalize code
