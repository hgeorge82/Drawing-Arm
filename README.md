# Scara Drawing-Arm

## ...
The purpose of this project is to make a scara robot arm that will a specific image. Using G-code format and interpreting it through arduino. Using a grbl github helps not go through the trouble of converting g-code to arduino, instead it does it for us.


## Supplies 
-2 stepper motors
-A servo 
-Arcylic 3mm
-3d printed part...
-Arduino
-Arduino cnc shield
-Stepper motor driver board

## Milestones?
Converting g-code to arduino, a specific design that works
Having a sturdy base/arm
Having an arm that moves
Having the arm move with g-code coordinates converted to polar coordinates
Finalize code

































## Timeline?
-Plan and research code
-Write code and prototype
-Prototype/plan arm
-Design arm
-Finalize code
