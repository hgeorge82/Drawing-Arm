# Scara Drawing-Arm

## Goal
To make a Scara drawing arm that will draw an image, specifically the sigma lab logo. ![Sigma logo](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Drawing-Arm/blob/main/images/Chs%20sigmalogo.png)

## Supplies needed
- 2 stepper motors
- A servo 
- Arcylic 3mm
- 3D printed part...
- Arduino
- Arduino cnc shield
- Stepper motor driver board
- grbl repository
- Worm screw?

## Milestones
Plan and research code
Realized coding this was going to be hard so, using a grbl repository, we found an outline that does the coding for us. G-code is the code that's compatible with a scara arm. ![grbl screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71407017/149539549-78858c83-d3bb-411f-9aa4-52939c9474c7.png)

Stepper Motor wiring -There are 4 colored wires, Green, Yellow, Red, and Gray and on the CNC shield there are A1/A2 pins and B1/B2 pins. Red and Yellow go to the A1 & A2 pins while Gray and Green go to the B1 & B2 pins. ![Wiring](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Drawing-Arm/blob/main/images/Wiring.png)![Wiring](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Drawing-Arm/blob/main/images/Up%20close%20wiring.png)


## Description
![Onshape link](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Drawing-Arm/blob/main/images/Assembled%203D%20arm.png)
The arm will be controlled using two stepper motors. Either a servo on the end of the arm to control the writing utensil, or have the arm on a liftable base to reduce weight on the arm. The drawing part of the arm will be connected with a gear and will be moved with belts. On top of one of the stepper motors it starts of with a 3D printed piece sandwiched between two rings. On top of those rings starts the arm. The arm consists of two piece arcylic conncted with bolts. On top of those pieces is a stepper motor placed on top of the other one. 135mm drawing piece, 135mm arm parts, 45mm diameter ring, 31.831mm diameter gears, The two pieces that make up the base arm are 12.7 mm aparts. It will mainly be made up of arcylic with the addition of some 3d printed parts.
